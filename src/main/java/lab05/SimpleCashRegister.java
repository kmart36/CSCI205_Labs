 * The <code>CashRegister</code> class models a very simple cash register. The
 * cash register assumes that it has an unlimited supply of money in its drawer,
 * and thus this is not modeled. It handles the management of one transaction of
 * a time, where a transaction consists of a list of items purchased. This
 * register only logs the amount of each purchase in a single transaction.
